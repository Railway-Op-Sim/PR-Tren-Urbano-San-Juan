# Tren Urbano, San Juan, PR

_Tren Urbano_ is the name given to the rail transit system located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Currently the network consists of a single line which operates a distance of 11 miles across the city serving 16 stations.

At the time of this simulation (2026), the line is the only railway operating within Puerto Rico. There are future plans to expand the network further.

## Simulation

The simulation covers operation of the entire line Sagrado Corazón in the East and Bayamón in the West with rolling stock entering service from the maintenance depot located near to  	Martínez Nadal.

All stations are included:

* Sagrado Corazón
* Hato Rey
* Roosevelt
* Domenech
* Piñero
* Universidad
* Río Piedras
* Cupey
* Centro Médico
* San Francisco
* Las Lomas
* Martínez Nadal
* Torrimar
* Jardines
* Deportivo
* Bayamón

As the simulation is fairly straightforward it can be operated at a speed of at least 4x without major difficulty. A session has been included to setup automatic signals between crossovers.

Due to there being little resource available on the specification of the operating Siemens rolling stock, and there being no access to a working timetable this should be considered an approximation, not an accurate representation.

## Development
